        <h1>Value at risk (VaR)</h1>
        <ul>
        <li> VaR is a risk measure which estimates riskiness of a portfolio.</li>
        
        <li> Key parameters of VaR are holding period and confidence level:</li>
        
        <ul>
        
        <li> Holding period - time period during which we hold (=are forced by illiquidity to hold) our portfolio and during which we can realize loss</li>
        
        <li> Confidence level - usually 95% or 99%, it detemines what probability we attribute to 'standard market'</li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <li> Definition: VaR is a possible loss (expressed in currency terms) which won't be realized on our portfolio during the holding period with a given confidence level.</li>
        
        <li> Less abstract definition: if $VaR_{95\%}(10 ~ days)=2 ~ MEUR$, then during next 10 days we won't lose more than 2 MEUR on our portfolio with 95\% probability.</li>     
        
        <li> And vise versa - there is 5% probability we will lose more than 2 MEUR during next 10 days</li>
        
        <li> VaR is widely used across many industries but has shortcomings...</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Issues with VaR</h1>
        One should be alert while using VaR because:
        <ul>
        <li> VaR doesn't give you the ultimate possible loss</li>
        <li> Real loss could be much higher than VaR, especially if loss distribution has fat tails</li>
        <li> VaR is not a coherent risk measure because it is not subadditive (grouping doesn't necessarily lower riskiness)</li>
        <li> By changing holding period and confidence level you also change the value and interpretation of VaR</li>
        <li> There are actually two definitions of VaR depending on what we consider loss:</li>
        <ul>
        <li> Absolute VaR - loss in the accounting sense</li>
        \begin{equation}
        VaR=Q_{95\%}(L)=-Q_{5\%}(P)
        \end{equation}
        <li> Relative VaR - loss in the economic sense</li>
        \begin{equation}
        VaR=Q_{95\%}(L)-E(L)=E(P)-Q_{5\%}(P)
        \end{equation}
        </ul>
        Q is quantile, L is loss distribution, P is profit distribution (L=-P)
        <li> If $E(L)=0$, then both definitions give the same VaR</li>   
        </ul>
        </section>
        
         
        <section>
        <h1>Tails of distributions</h1>
        <ul>
        <li> Tails of a distribution are its beginning and end</li>
        <li> Fat-tailed distributions are characterized by their high skewness and kurtosis</li>
        <li> Skewness - how symmetrical the distribution is</li>
        \begin{equation} 
        Skewness=\frac{E\left[(X-\mu)^3\right]}{\sigma^3}
        \end{equation}
        Positive skewness means that the distribution is skewed to the right, with negative skewness to the left
        <li> Kurtosis - tells us what is the proportion between distribution mass around the mean and the mass on its tails</li>
        \begin{equation}
        Kurtosis=\frac{E\left[(X-\mu)^4\right]}{\sigma^4}
        \end{equation}
        Kurtosis of Normal distribution is 3, distributions with kurtosis higher than 3 are said to be leptokurtic (=fat-tailed).

        <h1>Conditional value at risk (Expected shortfall)</h1>
        <ul>
        <li> Conditional value at risk CVaR (=Expected shortfall, ES) is a risk measure which addresses subadditivity and fat-tails</li>
        <li> It answers the question what is our loss if we hit the VaR threshold</li>
        \begin{equation}
        CVaR_{\alpha}=E[L|L>VaR_{\alpha}]=\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\int_{Var_{\alpha}}^{\infty}x.l(x) dx = \frac{1}{1-\alpha}\int_{\alpha}^{1}Q_l dl
        \end{equation}
        where l is the distribution of loss L
        <li> CVaR is subadditive and spots (although in average sense) a fat-tailed distribution</li>
        <li> CVaR is more demanding on the accuracy of price distribution as we calculate expected value only of that $(1-\alpha)$-part of it</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Risk methodology for power generation}</h1>
        <ul>
        <li> Key assumption of VaR is that we can closewhole position during holding period. This is not always the case.</li>
        <li> Production of power generation is shaped (probably coming from spread modelling) - it doesn't consist of standardized blocks which can be traded on the exchange</li>
        <li> Total production can be divided in hedgeable position and residual position</li>
        \begin{equation}
        Total ~ position=Hedgeable ~ position + Residual ~ position
        \end{equation}
        <li> Residual position (which cannot be closed) must be delivered on the spot but similar reasoning as with VaR can be applied $\rightarrow$ profit at risk</li>
        <li> Profit at risk (PaR) - what is the maximum loss (again, in the sense of confidence level) that can be incurred if we deliver residual position on the spot</li>
        </ul>
