                        <li> Hydrocarbons = {natural gas, crude oil, coal}</li>
                        <li> Hydrocarbons are made up of the elements hydrogen and carbon, plus impurities</li>
                        <li> The lower the number of carbon molecules, the lighter the compound</li>
                        <li> # of carbon molecules: gas $<$ crude oil $<$ coal</li> <li> Laws of physics</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> increased pressure: gas $\Rightarrow$ liquid</li>
                            <li> increased temperature: liquid $\Rightarrow$ gas</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> Natural gas - hydrocarbons in the gas phase at standard temperature and pressure (room
                            temperature, atmospheric pressure): methane ($C_1H_4$), ethane ($C_2H_6$), propane
                            ($C_3H_8$), butane ($C_4H_{10}$)</li>
                        <li> Sometimes $C_{5+}$ components (pentane-hexadecane) added to the definition because they
                            could be gases in the reservoir </li>
                    </ul>

            <h1>Natural gas components</h1>

                <ul>
                    <li> Methane - main component of natural gas (usually 70%-90%)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> dry gas - more than 95% of methane</li>
                        <li> wet gas - less than 95% of methane</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> LNG (liquefied natural gas) - liquid product produced by cooling methane to -161.5 degrees Celsius</li>
                    <li> LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) - propane and butane in pressurized containers</li>
                    <li> NGL (natural gas liquids) - ethane, propane, butane, $C_{5+}$</li>
                    <li> The heavier hydrocarbon, the more carbon molecules, the more heat generated, the higher price
                        premium to the price of pure methane</li>

                </ul>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>Impurities and ecology</h1>

            <ul>
                <li> Nonhydrocarbon components - carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), hydrogen sulfide ($H_2S$), hydrogen,
                    nitrogen, helium, argon</li>
                <li> $CO_2$ and $H_2S$ must be removed before transport and sale - they can corrode pipelines and are
                    air polutants, $CO_2$ is a green house gas</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> sour gas - high level of $H_2S$</li>
                    <li> sweet gas - low level of $H_2S$</li>
                </ul>
                <li> inert gases nitrogen, helium and argon are neither corrosive nor toxic, but their presence reduces
                    overall heat energy contained in the gas</li>
                <li> Natural gas is the cleanest burning primary fossil fuel, burning methan releases only $CO_2$ and
                    water. </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Natural gas storage</h1>

            <ul>
                <li> Gas storage facilities are buffer between supply and demand because production is constant but
                    demand is cyclical.</li>
                <li> Excess supply is injected in summer into storage and withdrawn during winter.</li>
                <li> Two uses:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Long-term base load storage - meets seasonal demand increases. Gas is injected during
                        low-demand months and withdrawn during high-demand season.</li>
                    <li> Short-term peak load storage - designed to have high deliverability for short periods of time,
                        covers daily and intra-day swing.</li>
                </ul>
                <li> Pipeline could be used as a peak load storage.</li>
                <li> Low injections in the summer provide an indication that demand is high relative to production and
                    that the industry may enter the heating season with a low inventory buffer $\Rightarrow$ prices
                    should go up</li>
                <li> High levels of natural gas in inventory close to the end of winter send strong bearish signal
                    because market will be flooded with unusually high supply.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>Storage characteristics</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> The higher the pressure in the storage facility, the more readily the gas may be extracted.</li>
                <li> Cushion gas - gas which must remain in storage because it cannot be recovered (due to equal
                    pressures at the wellhead).</li>
                <li> Working gas - gas which is stored and withdrawn on each cycle.</li>
                <li> Deliveribility - measure of the amount of gas which can be withdrawn on a daily basis.</li>
            </ul> Types of storages:

            <ul>
                <li> Depleted gas reservoirs - cushion gas and infrastructure already in place, cheapest to operate and
                    maintain</li>
                <li> Aquifers - rock formations which used to be water reservoirs, expensive to develop, high cushion
                    gas requirements (up to 80%)</li>
                <li> Salt caverns - high deliverability and minimum leakage, lowest cushion gas requirements (1/3)</li>
            </ul>

        </section>

            <h1>Gas hubs</h1>

            <ul>

                <li> Hub - central place for trading activity where supply and demand meet, either physical delivery or
                    virtual trading</li>

                <li> Main hubs in Europe:</li>

                <ul>

                    <li> NBP (GB)</li>

                    <li> TTF (NL)</li>

                    <li> NCG, GPL (DE)</li>

                    <li> ZTP (BE)</li>

                    <li> PEGN, TRS (FR)</li>

                    <li> CEGH (AT)</li>

                    <li> PSV (IT)</li>

                </ul>

                <li> Majority of trades is concluded on NBP or TTF.</li>

                <li> Very high correlation between hubs $\rightarrow$ Western/Central Europe is a single integrated
                    market area with good connectivity</li>

            </ul>

        </section>

        <section>

            <h1>Gas producers in Europe</h1>

            <ul>

                <li> Key players are Russia (Gazprom) and Norway (Statoil) with combined market share over 50 % (other
                    main producers are Algeria and Netherlands)</li>

                <li> Both companies tried/try to influence the price by supply management which keeps prices below
                    costs of new gas suppliers of US LNG but high enough to maximize rent</li>

                <li> Higher liquidity in hubs forces supplier to switch from indexed oil formulas (with high premiums)
                    to hub based evaluation.</li>

                <li> Imports of LNG shall grow. Azerbaijan is about to enter market in 2019.</li>

            </ul>
