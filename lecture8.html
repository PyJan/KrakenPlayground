                <ul>
                    <li> There is no single 'volatility'! Every volatility is defined and estimated in the context of a
                        specific stochastic process (which is not mentioned at all in some books...).</li>
                    <li> Volatility is always measured per some unit of time (day, week, year and so on).</li>
                    <li> Volatility should always capture features of the market it describes, for example seasonality
                        in energy markets.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li> Geometric Brownian motion is following process:</li>
                        \begin{equation}
                        dS=\mu S dt + \sigma S dz
                        \end{equation}
                    <li> GBM is a process where proportional changes in asset price (dS/S) have constant drift $\mu$
                        and volatility $\sigma$</li>
                    <li> By integrating GBM equation we learn that S is continuously compounded with return rate $\mu$
                        (on average)</li>
                    <li> From set of prices $\{S_i\}$ we calculate volatility $\sigma$ by following steps:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Calculate continuously compounded return:</li>
                                \begin{equation}
                                \ln \frac{S_i}{S_{i-1}} \cong \frac{S_i-S_{i-1}}{S_{i-1}}
                                \end{equation}
                            <li> Calculate standard deviation of those returns</li>
                            <li> Apply the correct multiplication factor</li>

            <h1>Multiplication factor for GBM</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li> In step 1 and 2 we have calculated volatility for time period between $S_i$ and $S_{i-1}$</li>
                    <li> If we want volatility for a time unit which is T-times longer, we need to multiply our result</li>
                        by $\sqrt{T}$
                    <li> So if we have daily data, we must multiply by $\sqrt{250}$ (number of trading days) to obtain
                        annual volatility (volatility where time unit is one year).</li>
                    <li> Factor $\sqrt{T}$ is applicable everytime we calculate volatility of the sum of independent
                        and identically distributed random varibles (in the case of GBM we add up returns which are
                        independent and normally distributed) because</li>
                        \begin{equation}
                        \sigma^2_{x_1+x_2+...+x_n}=\sigma^2_{x_1}+\sigma^2_{x_2}+...+\sigma^2_{x_n}

                <ul>
                    <li> The logarithm of our mean-reverting model, $x=\ln S$, follows the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
                        (O-U):</li>
                        \begin{equation}
                        x=\alpha(\bar{x}-x)dt+\sigma dz
                        \end{equation}
                        where $\bar{x}=\mu-\sigma^2/2\alpha$
                    <li> For the purpose of parameter estimation we can turn this equation into a regression of $x_i$
                        on $\Delta x_i$</li>
                        \begin{equation}
                        \Delta x_i=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 x_i + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \epsilon_i
                        \end{equation}
                    <li> From $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ we can calculate $\alpha$ and $\mu$. $\sigma$ can be estimated
                        from the same equation.</li>
                    <li> This approach is applicable for small $\Delta t$ only (differential equation is a limit of our
                        discretization when $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$)!</li>
                    <li> The set of $\Delta x_i$ is not independent (depends on the value of x). How should we scale
                        volatility? What if $\Delta t$ is big?</li>

                        \begin{equation}
                        x_{i+1}=e^{-\alpha \Delta t}x_{i}+(1-e^{-\alpha \Delta t})\mu +\sigma \sqrt{\frac{1-e^{-2\alpha

                            <li> Value in the next step $x_{i+1}$ is a weighted average of current value $x_i$ and

                            <li> Distribution of x at any time is Normally distributed.</li>
                            <li> When $\Delta t \rightarrow \infty$, then the limiting distribution has standard
                                deviation $\sigma/\sqrt{2\alpha}$</li>
                            <li> Term $\sqrt{\frac{1-e^{-2\alpha \Delta t}}{2\alpha}}$ is our scaling factor for time

            <h1>Volatility of forwards</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li> Forward price can be calculated as discounted expected value of future spot price using
                        risk-neutral measure. For this reason volatility of forward price increases as maturity date
                        nears.</li>
                    <li> On the other side, volatility of constant-maturity forwards is quite constant. This is also
                        true if we have a standard forward with long maturity $\rightarrow$ we will assume constant
                        volatility for forwards...</li>
                    <li> The most basic approach to estimate volatility of a forward is to assume independence of price
                        changes which usually leads to SMA and EWMA estimators.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li> For price modelling and VaR estimation, we need to know future value of model parameters.</li>
                    <li> Simpliest way to estimate volatility is to use simple moving averge.</li>
                    <li> When we have a set of N returns (of forward) $x_i$ then</li>
                        \begin{equation}
                        \hat{\sigma}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i-\mu)^2}
                        \end{equation}
                    <li> The key is to choose the right number N of latest observations (which is true for any method).</li>
                    <li> If N is too low, then our observations are the most recent but we have poor statistics. If N
                        is too high, we might include observations which misrepresent the future.</li>

                        relevant...</li>
                    <li> EWMA model addresses the issue by giving older observations exponentially less weight:</li>
                        \begin{equation}
                        \hat{\sigma}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^N \lambda^{i-1}}\sum_{i=1}^N \lambda^{i-1}(x_i-\mu)^2}
                        \end{equation}
                    <li> Following approximation of normalizing factor could be made:</li>
                        \begin{equation}
                        \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^N \lambda^{i-1}}=1-\lambda
                        \end{equation}
                    <li> $\lambda \in (0,1)$ is called the decay factor and determines how weights are distributed.</li>
                    <li> $\lambda$ close to 1 gives almost equal weights while small $\lambda$ almost forgets older
                        observations</li>

                    <li> Price jumps influence SMA by remaining in moving window with an equal weight. Sudden
                        appearance and disappearance from calculation.</li>
                    <li> Price jumps disappear from EWMA gradually but the first impact is bigger than in SMA!</li>
                    <li> Sudden changes in calculated volatility due to price jump could put analytic's credibility in
