            <h1>Terminology</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> Crude oil - unrefined petroleum which exists in liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs</li>
                <li> Refining - process of purification of crude oil</li>
                <li> Major refined products are:</li>

                <ul>
                    <li> Gasoline - used for cars</li>
                    <li> Diesel - used for cars</li>
                    <li> Kerosene - jet engines, tractors</li>
                    <li> LPG (propane, butane) - fuel, petrochemical input</li>
                    <li> Naphtha - intermediate that can be further processed to make gasoline</li>
                    <li> Residual fuels, coke, asphalt, benzene, toluene, xylene, petrochemicals, lubricating
                        oil....</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Crude oil characteristics</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> There are many types of crude oil</li>
                <li> Roughly 160 different grades of crude oil are traded internationally</li>
                <li> Two most qualities are:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Viscosity (thickness, density) - lighter crudes are more valuable as they produce more
                        valuable refined products, measured in API gravity, oil with API gravity below 10 is
                        heavier than water and vise versa</li>
                    <li> Sulfur content - the greater the sulfur content, the more costly the refining process</li>
                    to remove it, sour crudes - high sulfur content, sweet crudes - low surfur content
                </ul>
                <li> Two most important oil benchmarks (prices of other oils are calculated by adding a negotiated
                    differential to the benchmark price) are (both are light and sweet):</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> WTI (West Texas intermediate) - API gravity 39.6 degrees, 0.24% sulfur</li>
                    <li> Brent Blend (the North Sea, UK) - API gravity 38.3 degrees, 0.37% sulfur</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h1>Refineries</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> Every refinery is different in the sense of technological flexibility</li>
                <li> Producing higher-margin products costs more as more advanced technology needs to be used</li>
                <li> The mix of products is driven by:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Refinery complexity - ability to process crude feedstocks into value-added products,
                        expressed in Nelson Complexity Index, crude distillation has factor of 1.0, very
                        complex refineries have NCI over 9</li>
                    <li> Location - location determines how well the refinerey can access feedstocks and
                        distribute its product, if products cannot be moved to market, there is no value in
                        refining them</li>
                    <li> Product demand - market demand has huge impact on refinery profitability, demographics
                        plays a key role, motor fuel preferences can change</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>Refining value and crack spreads</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> Refiners' profits depend on the spread (difference) between the price of crude oil and the
                    prices of refined products $\Rightarrow$ crack spread</li>
                <li> Crack spread represents the theoretical refining margin and is quoted in dollars per barrel.</li>
                <li> Crack spread must take local preferences into account:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> US - 3:2:1 spread because it uses ratio of 3 crude to 2 gasoline plus 1 heating oil</li>
                    <li> Europe - 6:2:3:1 spread (6 crudes, 2 gasoline, 3 diesel, 1 residual)</li>
                </ul>
                <li> Positive crack spread $\Rightarrow$ value of outpus is higher than value of inputs
                    $\Rightarrow$ positive gross cracking margin</li>
                    <p>
                    Q: 3:2:1 crack spread when crude USD 38.00/barrel, gasoline USD 1.00/gallon and heating oil
                    USD 0.90/gallon?</p>
                    <p>
                    A: USD 2.6 = (1.00 x 42 x 2 + 0.90 x 42 - 3 x 38)/3</p>
            </ul>

            <h1>Production of oil</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> The primary driver of cost is the nature and geography of the reservoir</li>
                <li> Oil industry is a sector (as with other commodities) where competition is primarily
                    cost-based, companies cannot obtain competetive advantage by differentiation</li>
                <li> There are 3 possible stages of oil recovery:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Primary recovery - uses natural reservoir pressure</li>
                    <li> Secondary recovery - external fluid or gas is injected into reservoir in order to
                        increase reservoir pressure</li>
                    <li> Tertiary recovery - try to change chemical conditions of crude (by altering viscosity
                        or adhensive tensions) - thermal recovery, chemical flooding, gas injection</li>

                </ul>
                <li> Both secondary and tertiary recovery are extremely expensive and can be justified only by
                    stable high oil prices</li>
            </ul>
